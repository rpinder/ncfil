A basic file browser using Ncurses

Running 'ncfil' will output the relative filepath to the chosen file through stdout. The idea is for it to be used in conjunction with another command.

vim $(ncfil) - This will open ncfil and then open the chosen file in vim.
cat $(ncfil) - This will open ncfil and then print the chosen file to stdout.
